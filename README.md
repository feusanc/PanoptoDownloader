# PanoptoDownloader
Downloads videos from Panopto

ChromeDriver 97.0.4692.71 is required, any above version is incompatible.


--How to use--

Log in to panopto from opened web browser and do not close the main tab until all your downloads are finished.

If the video is recorded live then it won't show any progress since it will be downloading every part of it and then combining them. If the video is recorded first and then uploaded to panopto then it is probably in .mp4 format, while downloading it the progress will show. 

Right now it only detects and downloads .mp4 and .ts files.
